# Decision-Tree
I developed a Decision Tree model using an HR employee attrition dataset to predict factors influencing employee turnover. The model analyzes key attributes, helping identify patterns and trends related to retention. This approach provides actionable insights for HR to improve employee engagement and reduce attrition rates effectively.
